        <p>Perhaps the nerd life's becoming a bit more mainstream. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, the percentage of people going to college has been on the rise. To be more specific, the years between 2000 and 2012 saw an overall increase in 18-24 year-olds going to two-year and four-year institutions. But, who exactly is going to college, and what factors could be deciding who gets to tackle textbooks?</p>

        <p class="step">In fall 2012, 20.6 million students enrolled in American colleges and universities, <a target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_105.20.asp?current=yes">according to the National Center for Education Statistics.</a> This indicates a roughly 34 percent increase in total enrollment since fall 2000.</p>
        <p class="step">The chart above looks at the percentage of all 18-24 year-olds who attended an American institution. In 2000, 35.5 percent of all 18-24 year-olds went to college. That percentage climbs to 41.1 percent by 2012.</p>
        <p class="step">However, this chart represents everybody, regardless of gender. How does it change if we break it down?</p>

        <hr />

        <p>Broken down by gender, the data shows a clear split in educational endeavors. Females throughout the years have attended college at a higher percentage than males. On averge, females attended with a percentage of 41.9; men only 35.7.</p>
        <p>According to the <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/jan07/w12139.html">National Bureau of Economic Research</a>, this split relfects a reversal that's been long in the making. In 1960, there were 1.6 males for every female graduating, and 1.55 males for every female undergraduate. In 2003, the statistics flipped: 1.35 females for every male graduating, and 1.3 females for every male undergraduate.</p>
        <p>Many factors have led to this occurrence. Starting in the 1970s, women postponed marraige after college. In the '50s and '60s, women tended to marry within a year after graduation. That time frame expanded to 2.5 years in the '70s, allowing more time for further education.</p>
        <p>The '70s also brought about the legal use of contraceptive pills by married and single individuals. In the Supreme Court case "Baird v. Eisenstadt," the justices ruled that anyone, regardless of marital status, can use the pill. This went against a prior notion that only married people could use birth control. With this decision, more women could better plan their futures.</p>
        <p>The data, however, can be broken down more. What if we focused on how genders differ across races and ethnicities?</p>

        <p>Breaking News: College is expensive. Breaking Breaking News: That may not change any time soon. According to a <a href="http://time.com/money/4098683/college-board-tuition-cost-rose-inflation-2015/">report by Money Magazine</a>, the average published tuition for students at public and private rose in 2015. Overall, the cost of public schools for in-state students rose to $9,410, up 2.9 percent from 2014. For private schools, the average tuition hit $47,831, a 3.4 percent increase. Community college prices climbed 3 percent to about $3,400.</p>
        <p>The map below displays the average cost of tuition at public schools across the U.S. However, the cost of a four-year institution varies from that of a two-year. Toggle between the two maps to get of view of both types of public instituitons.</p>

        <p>The cost of college over time has changed as well, and not necessarily for the better. Since the 1970s, the cost of college has grown at a rate faster than inflation, steadily making a dollar's value less and less when used to pay for college. Even without looking as far back as 1970, the increase in college costs is apparent. The data below ranges from 2004 to 2015.</p>

        <p>At the same time, the amount of financial aid given by college institutions, state and federal government has been on the rise since the 1990s. A dramatic spike -- a 66 percent increase -- in aid from all these sources occurred between 2008 and 2009. This increase seems to show that financial aid is trying to keep up with the rise of college costs. The amounts are represented in thousands.</p>
